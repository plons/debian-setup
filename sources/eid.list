# To enable the candidate repository, uncomment the below line, put "deb" in
# front of it, and run "dpkg-reconfigure eid-archive" to enable the archive
# key.
#
# The candidate repository contains unsupported prerelease packages. Use at
# your own risk.
#
# Note, however, that the candidate repository is usually empty; it is
# used when we're preparing (and testing) a new release. Therefore, it
# should be relatively safe.
#
# There is also another "continuous" repository, for which packages get
# recompiled for each and every change to the source. This isn't listed
# (so that it can't be accidentally enabled), but the configuration is
# the same as the below, with "candidate" replaced by "continuous".

# The regular repository with released packages. This is what you should
# use.
